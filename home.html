                <p>My name is Ramses Feliciano, I'm an aspiring software developer that has always wanted to learn to code and is finally being given a chance to achieve my dream. I first started learning how to code in high school and loved it, computer science was easily my favorite class. I took all the computer classes I could during high school including an AP class but unfortuanetly when I graduated I went straight into the workforce and wasn't able to purse programming anymore.</p>
                <p>All of my workforce experience has taught me many things even though none of them had anything to do with technology. While working I learned a lot of skills that will always be useful throught my life including interacting with others professionally, how to be confidence, and develope proper work ethic. Though I did learn a lot from my past jobs I always felt like I could learn so much more and wanted to learn something I truely enjoyed.</p>
